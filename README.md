# How

## Plugin Ideas

Here is a list of optional plugin ideas to get you started. Remember
"optional": everything that has been set up is only there as a
convenience. **Nothing is set in stone!**

In no particular order, here are the ideas:

* XMPP/Jabber server integration
* Build status buttons (green "passing", red "failing", etc)
* Value stream un-blocker
* **your idea here :)**

## Team GoCD servers

We have set up GoCD servers that your team can use (optional, remember?)
The Vagrant definition for this server is hosted on our [Vagrant GoCD
repo fork and
branch](https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/ansible-gocd/tree/hackathon).
Be aware that we have manually loaded in a customized `config.xml` which
includes a lot of hackathon-friendly pre-configuration. If you want to
try manually loading that file into your GoCD server, you can find it
[here](https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/ansible-gocd/blob/hackathon/files/config.xml).

## Team Repositories

We have set up Github repositories and linked them to value streams in
your team's GoCD servers. Remember that word "optional"? That applies to
these repositories too!

As an example, team Gambit has the following Github repositories:

* https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/Gambit-Apple
* https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/Gambit-Banana
* https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/Gambit-Loon
* https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/Gambit-Mink
* https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/Gambit-Newt
* https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/Gambit-Yttrium
* https://github.com/L3-DT-Hackathon/Gambit-Zinc
